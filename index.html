				<h1>You are bad at playtesting and it's holding you back</h1>

					<aside class="notes">
	<p>Hi. I'm Matthew, I made video games - actually these days I'm making ONE video game, it's a bit different but anyway that's another story</p>

	<p>This talk is aimed at small-time indies, small teams and individuals who haven't made a hit game yet. If you have made a hit game you probably shouldn't listen to me, i mean you're probably not terrible at playtesting, otherwise your game would be bad.</p>

	<p>I'm here to talk to people who's games are still kinda bad.</p>

					<h2>indie life</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
	The whole point of being an indie is that you can build the game you want to make. You're the boss. Only your opinion matters. You don't have to compromise your design or add terrible microtransactions. Unfortunately, that attitude makes you a shitty playtester and now your game sucks.

					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
<p>what is a playtest? for the purpose of my talk, it's when you watch somebody play your game.</p>

<p>This talk's not about when you send out your game to your community and ask for feedback. I will touch on that as well but i've never done it myself so i'm just going to repeat something Tom Francis said about it.</p>

<p>When i was at university I took a paper called Human Computer Interaction where we learned about usability studies. A usability study is an experiment to see which of two different designs allows a user to complete a task faster or more easily - for example, when Trademe changes their layout, they might use a usability study to make sure the new layout is actually better.</p>

<p>most of my playtesting technique is just a less formal version of the usability studies i did at uni.</p>

<p>(these days you can read papers about playtesting, but back then...)</p>

					<h2>why do we playtest</h2>
					<ul>
					<li class="fragment">fame + fortune</li>
					<li class="fragment">brainware not software</li>
					<li class="fragment">you are not human</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
<p>we want lots of people to enjoy our game.</p>

<p>we want to get positive reviews on steam</p>

<p>we want to understand our game. a game isn't software, a game is a human activity. you can't understand a game until its being played by a human.</p>

<p>You can play the game yourself, but that's not a valid playtest because you know things that normal players don't. In one of my games, for a while, maybe players didn't realise you could shoot! I knew you could shoot. this made my play experience very different from theirs! But it's often more subtle than that.</p>

<p>for me playtesting at events (Armageddon, Minicades, the NZGDA meetup)</p>
<p>there are lots so it's easy</p>
<p>otherwise try your friends, pull out your game at parties or on campus. you need to talk to a human, you can't really avoid at at this point</p>

					<h2>matthew's rules of playtesting</h2>
					<h3 class="fragment">7 simple rules</h3>
					<p class="fragment">in order of how i felt like ordering themâ€¦</p>
					<aside class="notes">
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>1. never reveal anything</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">this is not your date!</li>
						<li class="fragment">keep quiet and watch what happens!</li>
						<li class="fragment">even subtle hints matter</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
<p>you're here to see your game interact with a human. just like they bought it on steam. they're not going to have you there explaining the rules, so don't explain the rules! don't reveal ANYTHING! </p>

<p>i've seen pppl do this. 5 playtests in a row, there is a game breaking problem - a STEAM REFUNDABLE PROBLEM - and the dev just says "oh yeah, press x to shoot" - and then they're like "yeah the playtest went really well i think the game's ready" NO IT DIDN'T! NO IT ISN'T! you just watched your game fail five people in a row and you didn't notice. KEEP QUIET AND WATCH WHAT HAPPENS</p>

<p>more subtle problems too - oh, don't go that way. oh, you should equip a weapon. oh, you build using gold, not stone - stone is ammo.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>


				<section>
					<h2>2. keep detailed notes</h2>
					<ul style="color: #CC9393;">
						<li class="fragment">OMG HAD TO TELL PLAYER HOW TO SHOT</li>
						<img class="fragment" src="menu-marker.png">
						<li class="fragment">mira thought the menu hightlights were nav<br> arrows + tried to follow them</li>
						<li class="fragment">mira still following menu markers</li>
						<li class="fragment">ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ OMG FIX MENU MARKERS ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
<p>if you do give players a hint, like "hey press X to shoot" gotta put it in your notebook. this is a big deal! I HAD TO GIVE PLAYER A HINT OMG telling something to the player is the reddest of red flags</p>

<p>but note other things as well. your memory sucks so write it down. During a playtest you'll see things so many things go wrong, you don't like to think about, you need to write these down clearly enough that later on, when you're by yourself, you'll still believe what you wrote. this is a hard one for me, it's like "Mira thought the menu hightlights were navigation arrows + tried to follow them"... later, I reread this and I'm like, "yeah but she probably figured it later"</p>

<p>i write a LOT of notes, about all kinds of things, but it's dangerous if you write down 30 issues (and you should), you might end up ignoring the 5 you don't feel like fixing, and focussing on the 25 easiest or the ones you already wanted to do. Instead, try to quickly prioritise by putting a big star next to the most serious, game-breaking issues. </p>

<p>future-you will try to tell you it doesn't matter, and ruin your playtest. Don't believe them.</p>

					<h2>3. DON'T ARGUE WITH EVIDENCE</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">everything that happens is real</li>
						<li class="fragment">â€¦but listen for problems not solutions</li>
						<img width=800 class="fragment" src="advisors.png">
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
<p>sometimes your playtesters will say something really stupid. don't argue with them. this is an experiment on what humans do when exposed to your game. you don't put a rat in a maze, then argue with it when it takes a wrong turn. this is an experiment so record what happens.</p>

<p>great example, someone was playing caves at an airport. he skippped my AWESOME INTRO SEQUENCE and skipped all the dialouge and said "You know no-one's going to read that, right?" </p>

<p>it's temping to argue</p>

<p>i could argue, i mean i'm a great writer, and ppl love my writing. and i have evidence to prove it! in my last 4 playtests...</p>

<p>But....</p>

<p>so I wrote down: This player skips all dialogue. This player thinks no-one will read the dialogue.</p>

<p>And that's a fact. i don't need to tell them what other players did, I'm studying THEM.</p>

<p>and arguing with them might change the way they play - which means this is no longer a true test of how they'd play if they bought the game on steam.</p>

<p>Now, on the other hand, be careful about feedback. people like to suggest CHANGES and FEATURES, but you are listing for PROBLEMS. sometimes it takes me many playtests to see the underlying problem.</p>

<p>for example Caves used to start with you in a cavern full of other survivors. Several people told me "you should just start with one friend, you should find the others as you explore" - and i was like "that's nice but will take ages to develop, i'm not adding a huge expensive feature just because you mentioned it"</p>

<p>...but later, someone finally said "it's confusing, i can't remember which npc to talk to, there's so many of them and most of them don't do anything"</p>

<p>and i was like: OH WOW it'd be cool if you just started with 1 NPC and then found the others one by one.... which ppl already told me, ok this is a weird example because what ppl were telling me was actually good... i guess my point is, understanding the problem is more important than listening to the suggestion.</p>

<p>When testing with ppl, especially game developers, I think of these people as the advisors in civilization II. None of them are wrong, but... take each with a grain of salt.)</p>

					<h2>4. PUT PEOPLE AT EASE</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">"We're testing the game, not you."</li>
						<li class="fragment">ask neutral questions</li>
						<ul>
						<li class="fragment" style="color: #CC9393; text-decoration:line-through">"Why do you keep trying to build things<br>you can't afford?"</li>
						<li class="fragment" style="color: #CC9393;">"What does this button do?"</li>
						<li class="fragment" style="color: #CC9393;">"What are you working on now?</li>
						</ul>
						<li class="fragment">watch your body language!</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
<p>"We're testing the game, not you," is the famous line."</p>

<p>ask questions in a non accusational way.</p>

<p>Mira using armour boosts in a weird way [...] i <br>
	i did NOT say "using jsut one of those is kind of useless"<br>
	i waited until i'd seen her do it a few times, then i asked<br>
	"what does this item do?"<br>
	(and she explained)</p>

	<p>beware leading questions<br>
	beware accusing questions<br>
	"is the tutorial confusing?" -- bad question! <br>
	"why do you keep trying to build things you can't afford?" - accusing and spoilers!<br>
	"what does this button do?" -- good question</p>

<p>body language</p>
	beware of judgey body language
	even positive can be bad - if player's stuck, then finally unstuck, the game should be enough positive feedback

<p>it is good to ask players to think out loud, but some just won't. it's fine.</p>

<p>	playtests are rare and precious<br>
	at armageddon, 10 players (caves) or 100 (Space Protecter)<br>
	do a new build during the event<br>
		Microsoft have an acronym for this, because they're microsoft. RITE: Rapid Iterative Testing and Evaluation<br>
	or overnight. do the quickest dirtiest version of the improvement<br>
	OR break my rule #1 and tell the players helpful things<br>

						<li class="fragment">schedule</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
	<p>you've learned a lot from your playtest. but this knowledge is useless if you just go back to the schedule you'd already planned. i see this a lot - a playtest shows 9 out of 10 players are getting confused by the tutorial, ask the devs what they're working on next and they're like "we're adding a new boss enemy to level 5!" - like, no-one's going to SEE level 5 if they quit during the tutorial.</p>

	<p>you've collected all this evidence about the biggest problems in your game. your schedule should change in response.</p>

				<section>
					<h2>7. START EARLY</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
<p>every day you work on your game without having done a playtest, you might be wasting your time on something that doesn't matter.</p>

<p>Valve are really good at playtesting and taking the feedback seriously.</p>

<p>* Portal 2 was originally going to have a different main character from Portal 1, but players found it confusing that the recurring villan GLADoS didn't recognise them from the previous game... Valve kept trying different solutions, but in the end nothing worked as well as just changing the main character back into Chell from the first game.</p>

<p>that's a hard decision - you've developed a story about a character... a lot of companies wouldn't have made that change... but much better to find in week 1 than week 200.</p>

--------------------------- Running big community playtests ----------------------

i've never done this but Tom Francis gave a talk about it at Stugan so I'm going to steal his highlights
<br><br>
* Ask for specific stuff first. Tom starts with 'Do you have any technical problems?' - this is because if people have this on their mind, they will put it into the first box and if that was 'what did you think of the game?' then you're going to miss out on actually getting that feedback. <br>
* He asked people to pick the best and worst level... then deleted the worst level each time. This was useful because he worked out that people dislike levels with no enemies, even though no-one ever directly said that.<br>
* Ask for a rating out of 10. With a lot of players, it gives you a nice metric to see if the game is actually getting better with each playtest.<br>
* He asked for the 'biggest problem' and 'best thing' as separate questions. This is important for your mental health. You can balance your intake of each. He once tried going through all the 'biggest problem' emails and got really depressed after about 80. (they were all different, so together they basically said the whole game was bad.) But the 'best thing' emails are useful AND make you feel good.<br>
